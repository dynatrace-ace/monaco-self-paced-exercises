## Exercise 3: Configuration variables

Envision a scenario where you have similar application configurations, either in the same or in a different Dynatrace environment. You want to uniformly configure these applications so you use the same JSON template. How can you handle a requirement where one of the settings (e.g. user session coverage percentage) must be different across instances of this template?

The goal of this exercise is to introduce variables in our JSON templates to manage this requirement.

First of all, download an example Monaco project from a shared repository and copy it into a newly created folder.
```bash
mkdir exercise-03
cd exercise-03
mv <DOWNLOADED-EXERCISE-FOLDER-PATH> .
```

### Step 1 - Explore configuration

#### Folder structure

1. After downloading the exercise files, explore the contents of the `exercise-03` folder. 

    ```text
    ├── apps
    │    ├── app-one
    │    │    ├── _config.yaml
    │    │    └── auto-tag.json
    │    ├── app-two
    │    │    └── _config.yaml
    │    └── shared
    │         ├── _config.yaml
    │         ├── application-detection-rule.json
    │         ├── application.json
    │         ├── csm.json
    │         ├── dashboard.json
    │         ├── health-check-monitor.json
    │         ├── k8s-auto-tag.json
    │         └── management-zone.json
    ├── infrastructure
    │    ├── _config.yaml
    │    ├── auto-tag.json
    │    ├── private-synthetic.json
    │    └── request-attribute.json
    ├── manifest.yaml
    ```

The folder includes two Monaco projects:
A project "infrastructure" that contains generic configuration related to the underlying infrastructure:
Auto tagging rules
Request attributes
Synthetic locations

A project "apps" that contains configuration specific to apps app-one and app-two:
Application definition
Application detection rules
Auto tagging rules
Calculated services metrics
Dashboards
Management zones
Synthetic monitors

#### Application configuration

2. Navigate to the application definitions stored in `apps/app-one/_config.yaml`

3. Take a closer look at the `application web` section

    ```yaml
    # application-web 
    - id: application-app-one
      type:
        api: application-web
      config:
        name: app-one
        template: ../shared/application.json
        skip: false
    ```

    We can see that this section makes use of a template stored in `../shared/application.json`. This template is also referenced from `apps/app-two/_config.yaml`

### Step 2 - Introduce variables

In order to use variables in a Monaco configuration, we must replace hardcoded values in JSON objects with variables using the following format:

```text
{{ .VARIABLE_NAME }}
```

> **Note:** Although this format is based on the Golang template library and notations, only selecting a specific field is fully supported, i.e. dot followed by name of field.

In our example, we want to turn RUM coverage percentage, represented in the configuration template by the field `costControlUserSessionPercentage`, in a variable called `rumPercentage`.

1. To do so, open the configuration template we identified earlier `apps/shared/application.json`

2. Find the field `costControlUserSessionPercentage` and notice that the value is hardcoded as `10`:

    ```json
    "costControlUserSessionPercentage": 10,
    ```

3. Turn the value of that field `10` into a variable:

    ```json
    "costControlUserSessionPercentage": "{{ .rumPercentage }}",
    ```

    > **Note:** Even though the variable placeholder doesn't represent a string value, it must still be surrounded with double quotes `"`
    >
    >The dot `.` in front of `rumPercentage` is also required as it's part of the format.

4. Save the changes

### Step 3 - Reference value and assign a value

Now that we have defined a variable in the JSON template, we can assign values to it in the YAML file that contains the instances of the template to be created.

1. Open the `apps/app-one/_config.yaml` file, add the variable, and assign a value to it like shown in the snippet below:

    ```yaml
    # application-web 
    - id: application-app-one
      type:
        api: application-web
      config:
        name: app-one
        template: ../shared/application.json
        skip: false
        parameters:
          rumPercentage: 100
    ```

    > **Note:** Parameters can be of different types with type `value` being the default. For `value` parameters, a short form syntax (e.g. `rumPercentage: 100`) can be used. Details on other supported types and examples can be found in the [docs](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/configuration-as-code/configuration/yaml-configuration#parameters).

2. Save the changes

3. Repeat these steps but with `rumPercentage: 50` in `apps/app-two/_config.yaml`

### Step 4 - Deploy the configurations

1. Go back to the `exercise-03` directory and run monaco deploy command first with dry-run option
    
    ```bash  
    monaco deploy manifest.yaml --dry-run   
    ```
    
2. If there is no validation error, you can now run monaco without a dry-run option to apply the configurations on your Dynatrace environment

    ```bash  
    monaco deploy manifest.yaml 
    ```
    
    It will now update the two application configurations and will change the `costControlUserSessionPercentage` from a fixed value to a parametrized value using Monaco.

### Step 5 - View results in Dynatrace

1. As a last step, go to your Dynatrace environment and verify that Monaco updated the application settings.
